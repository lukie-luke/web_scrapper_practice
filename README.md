# web_scrapper_practice
This is intended to collect information from job postings and analyze their experience requirements. 

## Background

I have recently found myself frustrated about the "entry level" job postings for Software Development positions which require many years of professional experience. In order to grow my practical skillset as a developer and alleviate some job-search-related tension, I will practice building a web scrapper in python to analyze the years of experience posted on "entry level" positions. Initially, I will be targetting postings on linkedin.
